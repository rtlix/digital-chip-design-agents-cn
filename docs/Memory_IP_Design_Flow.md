# Memory IP Design Flow

Embedded memory IP design — SRAM, register file, and ROM. Covers requirements
capture, macro selection, array architecture, redundancy and repair, view
generation and QA, and integration handoff.

## Architecture Overview

This domain treats the memory as the *product* rather than as a black box. The
rest of the pipeline consumes memories: PD places them, synthesis marks them
`dont_touch`, DFT tests them, SoC qualifies their views, FPGA swaps them for
BRAM. This flow is what produces them.

### Scope boundary

| Not owned here | Owner |
|---|---|
| MBIST insertion, March patterns, MBIST fault coverage, ATPG | `chip-design-dft` |
| Floorplanning, macro placement, power grid over macros | `chip-design-pd` |
| Timing sign-off, multi-corner STA, ECO closure | `chip-design-sta` |
| Address/memory map assignment, bus fabric attachment | `chip-design-soc` |
| Cache hierarchy and DDR controller architecture | `chip-design-architecture` |

The flow **produces the inputs** those domains consume — memory inventory and
repair-register map for DFT, placement constraints for PD, the `.lib` set and
derates for STA, behavioural models for verification.

## Shared State Object

Written into `design_state.json` under the `memory_ip` key:

```json
{
  "memory_ip": {
    "instances": [
      { "name": "", "type": "sram | rf | rom", "depth": 0, "width": 0,
        "ports": "1rw | 1r1w | 2rw", "macro": "", "banks": 0 }
    ],
    "total_area_um2": null,
    "views": { "lib": [], "lef": [], "db": [], "verilog": [], "gds": [], "cdl": [] },
    "repair": { "scheme": "row | column | both | none", "spare_rows": 0,
                "spare_cols": 0, "repair_reg_bits": 0, "efuse_map": null },
    "placement_constraints": [
      { "instance": "", "orientation": "", "halo_um": 0, "channel_um": 0, "group": "" }
    ],

## Stage Sequence & Loop-Back Logic

```text
memory_requirements → macro_selection → array_architecture → redundancy_repair →
view_generation → integration_prep → memory_signoff
```

| Failing stage | Condition | Loops back to | Max |
|---|---|---|---|
| `macro_selection` | no candidate meets access time | `memory_requirements` | 2× |
| `array_architecture` | area > 120% budget | `macro_selection` | 3× |
| `array_architecture` | bandwidth < target | `memory_requirements` | 1× |
| `redundancy_repair` | projected yield < target | `array_architecture` | 2× |
| `view_generation` | view QA errors > 0 | `macro_selection` | 2× |
| `integration_prep` | placement/channel infeasible | `array_architecture` | 2× |
| `memory_signoff` | Vmin margin short | `array_architecture` | 1× |

### Sign-off criteria (machine-checkable gates)
- `view_qa_errors: 0`
- `all_corners_characterized: true`
- `redundancy_allocated: true`
- `mbist_ports_exposed: true`
- `worst_access_time_margin_ns: > 0` at the slow corner, every instance
- `projected_repair_yield_pct >= constraints.memory_ip.repair_yield_pct_min`
- `vmin_margin_mv >= constraints.memory_ip.vmin_margin_mv`
- `placement_constraints_complete: true`

The full human checklist (area/bandwidth budgets, ECC read-path latency,
repair-register handoff, collision-policy consistency, `set_dont_touch`) is the
`memory_signoff` stage checklist in the SKILL file.

## Stage Summaries

Full domain rules, QoR metrics, and output requirements live in the SKILL file.
This is the orientation summary.

| Stage | Purpose | Key output |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_requirements` | Inventory every instance; classify RF/SRAM/ROM; compute bandwidth; decide ECC from FIT target; enumerate power modes | Instance inventory, ECC decision table |
| `macro_selection` | Sweep column mux factor and bank count; compare candidates on **slow-corner** access-time margin, area, leakage | Selected macro per instance + rejection rationale |
| `array_architecture` | Banking vs. true multi-port; port arrangement and collision policy; wrapper spec; ECC wrapper and scrubbing; Vmin/assist | Bank/port architecture, wrapper spec, ECC scheme |
| `redundancy_repair` | Size spares from defect density; choose repair scheme; size repair register; soft vs. hard repair; efuse map | Repair architecture + projected yield |
| `view_generation` | Generate `.lib`/`.lef`/`.db`/`.v`/`.gds`/`.cdl`; QA pin consistency, timing arcs, corner coverage, obstructions | Complete view set + QA report |
| `integration_prep` | Emit constraints for PD, inventory + repair map for DFT, `.lib` + derates for STA, behavioural model for verification | Handoff package |
| `memory_signoff` | Checklist over all of the above | Signed-off memory IP package |

## Constraints

**Required at entry (`memory_requirements`):**
- `constraints.clock.clk_mhz` — sets the access-time budget

**Optional (defaults apply):**

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_ip.vmin_margin_mv` | 50 | Minimum Vmin margin |
| `memory_ip.repair_yield_pct_min` | 99 | Projected post-repair yield floor |
| `memory_ip.ecc_required` | false | When true, forces **SECDED** as the floor regardless of the FIT calculation |
| `memory_ip.fit_target_fit_per_mb` | 100 | Soft-error budget (FIT per Mb) — the audited input to the ECC decision table |
| `memory_ip.max_aspect_ratio` | 4.0 | Macro aspect-ratio ceiling |
| `memory_ip.retention_required` | true | **Default only** — applies to instances with no explicit per-instance retention requirement; an explicit per-instance value always wins |

Two precedence rules are enforced at `memory_requirements`: `design_state.rtl`
outranks `design_state.architecture` for port/width/depth, and a conflict between
them escalates a `constraint_gap` rather than being silently resolved; and the ECC
scheme is chosen by a deterministic table keyed on `raw_FIT` vs. `budgeted_FIT`.

`constraints.pvt_corners` is **not defaultable** — if absent or lacking non-null
`voltage_v`/`temp_c`, `view_generation` escalates a `constraint_gap` rather than
characterising at typical only.

`constraints.dft.mbist_coverage_pct` is read-only here — owned by `chip-design-dft`.
