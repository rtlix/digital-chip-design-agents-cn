[![Validate](https://github.com/chuanseng-ng/digital-chip-design-agents/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chuanseng-ng/digital-chip-design-agents/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

## Quick Start

With Node.js (≥18), install everything with one command — no clone, no Python:

```bash
npx digital-chip-design-agents      # detects your AI agents and installs after a confirm
```

Then just describe your task in natural language:

```
Run the RTL design flow for my AXI DMA controller block
Analyse timing violations on this routed DEF and suggest ECOs
Build a UVM testbench for my FIFO block
```

Claude automatically loads the correct skill before executing.

For the install script, selective marketplace install, other AI assistants
(Copilot / Gemini / OpenCode / Codex), and all flags, see
**[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

## How It Works

Each plugin installs two things:

1. **A Skill** (`plugins/<domain>/skills/<domain>/SKILL.md`) — domain knowledge Claude reads
   before executing. Contains stage-by-stage rules, QoR metrics, common fixes, and output
   requirements.

2. **An Orchestrator Agent** (`plugins/<domain>/agents/<domain>-orchestrator.md`) — a subagent
   that manages the full multi-stage flow. It sequences stages, enforces pass/fail criteria,
   applies loop-back rules when a stage fails, and escalates clearly when human input is needed.

Skills are loaded autonomously by Claude when you describe a task. Orchestrators are
invoked explicitly when you want to run a complete flow end-to-end.

Each orchestrator enforces a strict stage sequence with loop-back rules, and the 14 domains
connect into a complete spec→tape-out pipeline. See **[docs/PIPELINE.md](docs/PIPELINE.md)**
for the flow diagram and loop-back details, and [docs/MASTER_INDEX.md](docs/MASTER_INDEX.md)
for per-domain flow documentation.

## Memory System

Each domain orchestrator reads from and writes to a two-tier persistent memory store under
`memory/`:

- **`memory/<domain>/knowledge.md`** — distilled summaries (failure patterns, tool flags, PDK
  quirks) read by every orchestrator at session start.
- **`memory/<domain>/experiences.jsonl`** — one record per run, upserted by `run_id`, written on
  every termination path (signoff, escalation, or abandon).

Distil accumulated records back into `knowledge.md` with the `memory-keeper` skill, and track
QoR metrics across runs with `tools/qor_trends.py`. See **[memory/README.md](memory/README.md)**
for the full schema, distilling workflow, and QoR trend examples.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). PRs welcome for:
- Improved domain rules or QoR metrics in any SKILL.md
- New loop-back rules in orchestrators
- New skill domains (e.g., package/assembly, analog integration)

CI validates all files on every PR — the validate workflow must pass before merge.
