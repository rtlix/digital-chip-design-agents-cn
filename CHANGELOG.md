# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — feat/reporting-contract branch

### Added

- **All 16 orchestrators**: new `## Reporting Contract` section (issues #75, #78), synced from `tools/agent_shared_sections.md`. Sign-off criteria were declarative properties with no rule that they be observed rather than asserted. The contract requires: run every named gate and quote its exact output; never report a gate as passing that was not run this session (report it NOT RUN, and why); exit 0 with empty or unparsable output is not a pass; re-read the deliverable list before finishing; separate measured values from inference; verify the provenance of any generated artifact a test consumes, in every environment that will run the test; and set `signoff` / `signoff_achieved` true only when every criterion is measured-PASS.
- **Codex, Gemini and Copilot headers**: five condensed lines of the contract added to `## Verification and Reporting`.
- **Wrapper JSON `verified` field**: `true` when `status` rests on a result parsed from the output or on a failure; `false` when the tool exited 0 without a recognisable result, or did not run. Documented in the infrastructure skill's wrapper schema.
- **Tests**: `tests/test_wrappers.py` runs each real wrapper through bash against a fake tool (skipped on Windows unless `RUN_WRAPPER_TESTS=1`); `tests/test_mcp_adapter.py` covers how the adapter interprets wrapper output.

### Changed

- **Behaviour change — all 8 EDA wrappers no longer report `PASS` without evidence.** Status was computed from the exit code and ERROR/WARNING lines alone, so a tool that exited 0 and printed nothing the wrapper recognised was a `PASS`. A wrapper now needs a result it parsed from the output; otherwise it reports `WARN` with `verified: false` and says so in the first warning. Evidence is the set of fields each wrapper already extracted — no new log markers. A quiet run (`yosys -q`, a `--version` smoke test) that returned `PASS` now returns `WARN`. The exit code is still propagated unchanged.
  - `wrap-verilator-sim.sh`: `PASS` requires `TEST PASSED`. An ERROR line with exit 0 gives `WARN`, not `FAIL`, since simulation logs print lines such as "Error count: 0".
  - `wrap-klayout.sh`: a report that parses with no categories is a clean run; with no report and no count in the log, `drc_total` is `null` rather than `0`.
- **Behaviour change — `mcp-adapter.py`**: with exit 0, empty wrapper output was `PASS` and non-JSON output was `WARN`; JSON without a valid `status` was passed through. All three are now `FAIL` with `verified: false`, because the wrapper contract is to emit JSON on every run. Valid wrapper JSON is passed through unchanged. `isError` stays tied to `status == "FAIL"`.
- **`mcp-session-adapter.py`**: `query_drc` returns `drc_total: null`, not `0`, when no count could be parsed.

## [Unreleased] — feat/shared-orchestrator-guards branch

### Added

- **Shared orchestrator sections, synced from one source** (issue #77). `tools/agent_shared_sections.md` holds the text every orchestrator carries word for word; `tools/sync_agent_sections.py` writes it into each target between `BEGIN SHARED` / `END SHARED` marker comments. `--check` reports drift and runs in CI, `--list` prints which block goes where. The script preserves each file's line endings, so a CRLF working tree and LF CI agree. Tests in `tests/test_sync_agent_sections.py`.
- **15 orchestrators**: new `## Stage Gating and Escalation` section — read the tool's result before assigning a stage status; never proceed past a FAIL without applying the loop-back rule; on an exhausted loop cap, stop and escalate with state and root cause; when the fault is in an upstream artifact, stop looping and hand back. These guards previously existed in one or two orchestrators each (`pd`, `rtl-design`, `memory-ip`, `architecture`, `infrastructure`); ten domain orchestrators had no rule at all for an exhausted loop cap. `pipeline-orchestrator` is excluded: it dispatches rather than runs stages and owns `pending_approval` type `escalation`.
- **`compiler` and `firmware` orchestrators**: new `### MCP Preference` section. No MCP server or wrapper exists for their toolchains, so it prescribes direct execution with output captured to a log file rather than the MCP → wrapper → direct tier list the EDA domains carry.
- **Codex, Gemini and Copilot headers**: new `## Verification and Reporting` section with the condensed guards. Copilot and Codex installs receive skills only, never agent files.
- **`.gitattributes`**: `* text=auto`, and `*.sh text eol=lf` so shell scripts are runnable from a Windows checkout.

### Changed

- **`pending_approval` ownership made consistent.** The pipeline skill allowed domain orchestrators only `type: "checkpoint"` while also requiring them to set `type: "constraint_gap"`, and a sentence in 15 orchestrators implied they set `pending_approval` on any escalation. Domain orchestrators now set it only at their two gates (checkpoint, constraint validation); an escalation for an exhausted loop cap or an upstream fault is recorded in the terminal `history[]` entry, whose `reason` carries the `failure_class` and what the user must supply. `type: "escalation"` stays reserved for `pipeline-orchestrator`. No schema change.
- **Existing one-off guards** in `pd`, `architecture`, `infrastructure`, `rtl-design` and `memory-ip` keep their rule numbers and now point at the shared section.
- **`validate.yml`**: agents must contain `## Behaviour Rules` (the anchor for the shared sections); new step runs `tools/sync_agent_sections.py --check`.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: documents the sync step, corrects the file paths in the "Adding a New Skill" steps and the local validation snippet (both referred to a root `skills/` directory that does not exist), and corrects the count rule (skills may exceed agents).
- Stale counts corrected in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/MASTER_INDEX.md`, `memory/README.md` and `FUTURE_WORK.md`.

## [Unreleased] — fix/signoff-achieved-template branch

### Fixed

- **13 orchestrators**: the `experiences.jsonl` template showed `"signoff_achieved": true` while the surrounding rules say the record is also written on escalation and abandonment (issue #74). `distill.py` counts sign-off with `is True`, so a template defaulting to `true` records failed runs as successes. The template now defaults to `false`, matching `pd` and `infrastructure`, and each one states the success condition directly beneath it (`soc` had no such sentence). A literal `false` is used rather than a `"<true|false>"` placeholder, because a string value never satisfies `is True`. `memory/README.md` carried the same literal in the canonical schema.
- **8 orchestrators** (`dft`, `firmware`, `fpga`, `memory-ip`, `rtl-design`, `sta`, `synthesis`, `verification`): said "append one JSON line" and gave a template with no `run_id`, contradicting `memory/README.md` and their own skills. They now upsert by `run_id` like the rest. The `fpga` skill's separate append-only schema (`stage`, `outcomes`, `metrics`, `tools`), which `distill.py` could not read metrics from, now points at the shared record schema. `README.md` no longer calls the file append-only.
- **6 orchestrators** (`architecture`, `dft`, `firmware`, `formal`, `fpga`, `hls`): the history `decision` enum omitted `await_approval`, which their own checkpoint gate writes.

### Added

- **`tests/test_agent_contract.py`**: static checks on agent and skill markdown — no hardcoded `"signoff_achieved": true`, no append-only wording, every experience template carries `run_id`, and every `decision` enum lists `await_approval` where the agent writes it.

## [1.8.0] — Memory IP Design domain

### Added

- **`chip-design-memory-ip` — 16th plugin, 14th design domain.** Embedded memory IP design (SRAM / register file / ROM): the pipeline previously treated memories as an externally supplied black box — PD placed them, synthesis `dont_touch`ed them, DFT tested them, SoC qualified their views, FPGA swapped them for BRAM — but nothing *produced* one. This domain fills that gap.
  - **`plugins/memory-ip/skills/memory-ip-design/SKILL.md`** — seven stages: `memory_requirements → macro_selection → array_architecture → redundancy_repair → view_generation → integration_prep → memory_signoff`. Covers bandwidth and ECC sizing, column-mux/banking trade-offs, slow-corner access-time selection, write/read assist and Vmin, SECDED check-bit sizing and scrubbing, spare row/column allocation from defect density, soft vs. hard repair and efuse mapping, and view QA (pin consistency across `.lib`/`.lef`/`.v`, timing-arc completeness, corner coverage, LEF obstructions).
  - **`plugins/memory-ip/agents/memory-ip-orchestrator.md`** — stage sequence, seven loop-back rules, sign-off criteria, and an explicit boundary rule: never insert MBIST or claim MBIST coverage (owned by `chip-design-dft`), never floorplan (`chip-design-pd`), never sign off timing (`chip-design-sta`), never assign the memory map (`chip-design-soc`).
  - **`design_state.json` handoff** — new `memory_ip` block carrying `instances`, `views`, `repair` (scheme, spare counts, repair-register width, efuse map), `placement_constraints`, `ecc`, and `power_modes`. DFT consumes `instances` + `repair`; PD consumes `placement_constraints`; STA consumes `views.lib`; verification consumes `views.verilog`.
  - **`constraints.memory_ip`** — `vmin_margin_mv` (50), `repair_yield_pct_min` (99), `ecc_required` (false), `max_aspect_ratio` (4.0), `retention_required` (true). `constraints.dft.mbist_coverage_pct` is read-only here.
  - **`memory/memory-ip/knowledge.md`** seed and `docs/Memory_IP_Design_Flow.md`.
  - `key_metrics`: `memory_instances`, `total_memory_area_um2`, `worst_access_time_ns`, `view_qa_errors`, `projected_repair_yield_pct`.

### Changed

- Counts bumped to **16 plugins / 17 skills / 16 agents / 14 design domains** across `marketplace.json`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PIPELINE.md`, `docs/MASTER_INDEX.md`, `docs/INSTALL.md`, the Codex/Gemini/Copilot IDE headers, and `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- **Manifest version realigned to the release tag line.** `package.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` had drifted to `1.3.0` while tags advanced to `v1.7.0`, and PR #71 bumped them to `1.4.0` — which matched neither the drift nor the tag line, and implied a `v1.4.0` tag after `v1.7.0`. Both now read `1.8.0`, the next tag for this MINOR change (new orchestrator domain, per `CONTRIBUTING.md`). The `npm-publish` job in `release.yml` stamps these fields from the tag at publish time, so the in-repo values are informational — but they should not contradict the tag they will be released under.
- `validate.yml` count asserts 15 → 16 (agents/marketplace and `applyto-map.json`); `tests/test_distill.py` domain count 14 → 15.
- `distill.py`, `tools/qor_trends.py`, `memory/README.md`, and `memory-keeper/SKILL.md` registered the new domain; `projected_repair_yield_pct` added to `HIGHER_IS_BETTER`.
- Installers updated: `install.sh` and `install.ps1` (plugin list, dir map, `enabledPlugins`, OpenCode mode map, completion message) and `bin/install.mjs` (`OPENCODE_MODE_DISPLAY`).

## [Unreleased] — feat/semantic-experience-search branch

### Added

- **Semantic / keyword search over experiences** (FUTURE_WORK item 2): a new way for orchestrators to retrieve prior fixes by relevance to a natural-language query (e.g. "what fixed WNS issues on sky130 before?") instead of reading the whole `experiences.jsonl`.
  - **`tools/experience_search.py`** — core library + standalone CLI. Default backend is a pure-stdlib **TF-IDF + cosine** ranker over the free-text fields (`issues_encountered`, `fixes_applied`, `notes`); reuses the shared `resolve_memory_root`, `load_records`, and `filter_by_design/pdk/tool` helpers so it sees exactly what orchestrators wrote. Returns ranked records with `score`, `matched_terms`, the `backend` used, and a `fell_back`/`fallback_reason` flag. CLI exit codes mirror the repo convention (`0` results, `1` no match, `2` error/bad memory root).
  - **Optional embedding backend, dormant by default** — `get_embedding_backend()` returns `None` until a deployment wires in an embedding library, keeping the repo stdlib-only. It activates only when a backend is available **and** the domain has ≥ `--min-records` records (default **50**, per the issue threshold); otherwise the tool transparently falls back to keyword. Embeddings cache in a stdlib `sqlite3` index (`<domain>/.experience_index.sqlite3`) keyed by record content hash, with incremental `--reindex`.
  - **`plugins/infrastructure/tools/mcp-memory.py`** — dedicated MCP stdio server (protocol `2024-11-05`, same scaffolding as `mcp-adapter.py`) exposing the `query_experiences` tool; **`plugins/infrastructure/mcp/mcp-memory.json`** — config template (server name `chip-design-memory`).
  - **Tests** — `tests/test_experience_search.py` (tokenizer, TF-IDF ranking, filter pre-narrowing, threshold/backend selection, sqlite cache incrementality + stale-hash eviction, CLI exit codes) and `tests/test_mcp_memory.py` (JSON-RPC `initialize`/`tools/list`/`tools/call` smoke + error codes).

### Changed

- **All 15 orchestrators**: added an optional "semantic experience lookup" note to the session-start memory block — call the `query_experiences` MCP tool when available, otherwise proceed with `knowledge.md` only (augments, never replaces). The note is tailored for the router (`pipeline-orchestrator`, queries the target producer domain) and the opt-in `infrastructure-orchestrator`.
- **`memory/README.md`**: new "Semantic / Keyword Experience Search" section documenting the CLI, the MCP server/config, the threshold/fallback semantics, the sqlite cache + `--reindex`, and the optional orchestrator read-path.
- **`FUTURE_WORK.md`**: item 2 marked implemented (phased); documented why the sqlite-vec/Chroma/hosted options were rejected in favor of a stdlib-only keyword default with a pluggable embedding hook.

## [Unreleased] — feat/agent-auto-detect branch

### Added

- **Auto-detection of installed AI coding agents**: running the installer with no `--ide` flag now detects which of the five supported agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Gemini, GitHub Copilot) are present, prints what it found and where each would write, and installs to them after a confirmation prompt. An agent counts as installed if its CLI is on `PATH` **or** its config directory exists (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.config/opencode`, `~/.gemini`); Copilot is project-scoped and detected via the `gh` / `copilot` CLI. New `bin/detect.mjs` is the single source of truth for the detection signatures.
- **`--yes` / `-y` (sh, mjs) and `-Yes` (ps1)** to skip the confirmation prompt; detection also auto-proceeds in non-interactive shells (CI, pipes).

### Changed

- **`bin/install.mjs` now installs all five targets natively in Node** — no Python dependency. The Copilot / Gemini / OpenCode / Codex generators that previously lived only in the Python blocks of `install.sh` were ported to Node, producing byte-identical output (modulo absolute paths and the "Generated by" comment). Gemini and OpenCode embed runtime file references, so under `npx` the referenced payload is copied to a durable `~/.digital-chip-design-agents/payload/` so the references survive package-dir reclamation. Explicit `--ide` (including `all`) bypasses detection and keeps its prior behaviour.
- **`install.sh` / `install.ps1`** gained the same detection mode (default when no `--ide`/`-IDE`). They still require `python3` (their Claude block reads plugin versions and merges `settings.json` via Python); the fully Python-free path is now the npm installer.
- **`README.md`**: documented auto-detection, the `--yes` flag, and that the npm path now installs every supported target.

## [Unreleased] — feat/structured-failure-handling branch

### Added

- **failure_class → retry_strategy mapping** (FUTURE_WORK item 10): every failure is now categorised into a recovery *strategy* — `regenerate | refine | escalate` — so retry behaviour is determined programmatically rather than by prose. The authoritative mapping is defined once in `plugins/meta/skills/pipeline-orchestration/SKILL.md` under `### Failure Classification & Retry Strategy`, reusing the existing 10-value `failure_class` enum (no new taxonomy). The four classes from the original draft (`invalid_rtl | verification_failure | interface_mismatch | incomplete_spec`) are reconciled as documented aliases.
  - **`regenerate`** — discard the faulty artifact and re-run the generating stage from a clean slate (`drc_lvs`, `connectivity`, `tool_error`).
  - **`refine`** — re-run targeting a specific defect with detailed feedback (`functional`, `timing`, `power_area`, `coverage_gap`).
  - **`escalate`** — halt and request human input (`spec_gap`, `resource_limit`); `none` ⇒ no retry.
- **`retry_strategy` history-entry field (`format_version "1.5"`)**: every `history[]` entry now carries `retry_strategy`, derived deterministically from `failure_class`. The pipeline-orchestrator decision table gains a `retry_strategy` column and branches on it as a coarse pre-filter (existing `confidence`/`suggested_next_step` precedence preserved; `resource_limit` and `low` confidence still always escalate).
- **Actionable escalation guidance**: when a strategy resolves to `escalate` or a max-iteration cap is hit, `pending_approval.reason` must state the `failure_class` plus a plain-language description of what the user must supply to unblock the flow.
- **Updated example fixtures**: `design_state.checkpoint.json` and `design_state.fix_request.json` bumped to `"1.5"` with `retry_strategy` on every history entry; the checkpoint fixture adds an illustrative `timing`/`refine` `synth_check` loop-back entry to exercise the non-`none` path.

### Changed

- **`format_version "1.5"`**: new capability tier covering the `retry_strategy` field and programmatic retry branching. All 14 history-writing orchestrators (the 13 domain orchestrators + infrastructure) upgrade to `"1.5"` on first write — including compiler/firmware/infrastructure, which advance from `"1.3"`; prior-version files remain readable (`retry_strategy` absent → derive from `failure_class`).
- **All 14 orchestrators + `pipeline-orchestrator.md`**: added `retry_strategy` to the Stage Agent Output Format and `history[]` schema (now 10 fields), updated the per-stage-trace behaviour rule to set and require it, and bumped the format_version upgrade step.
- **CI** (`validate.yml`): added `"1.5"` to `VALID_FORMAT_VERSIONS`, a `VALID_RETRY_STRATEGY` set and `RETRY_STRATEGY_MAP`, and a `check_retry_strategy` helper that validates each 1.5 history entry's `retry_strategy` against the value **and** its `failure_class` mapping, applied to both example fixtures.
- **`memory/README.md`**: documented `retry_strategy` in the `history[]` field list and added the `"1.4"` and `"1.5"` format_version tiers.

## [Unreleased] — feat/infrastructure-memory branch

### Added

- **Infrastructure orchestrator memory** (FUTURE_WORK item 4): opt-in, environment-keyed persistent tracking of tool versions and setup configuration under `memory/infrastructure/`, following the existing two-tier memory pattern (`knowledge.md` + `experiences.jsonl`).
  - **Opt-in, default off**: the infrastructure-orchestrator reads/writes `memory/infrastructure/` only when `design_state.pipeline_config.track_infrastructure == true` or it is invoked with `--track-memory`. When unset, no `memory/infrastructure/` I/O occurs — prior (memory-free) behavior is unchanged. This respects the original deferral rationale (infra state is environment-specific; lockfiles remain the primary version source of truth).
  - **Environment-keyed records**: each `experiences.jsonl` record carries an `environment` fingerprint (`host`, `os`, `os_version`, `arch`) and a `key_metrics.tool_versions` per-tool version map captured at `environment_validation` — the core value-add for diagnosing repeated version-mismatch debugging across sessions. Records are differentiated by environment, not by design (`design_name` is typically `null`).
  - **Seeded `memory/infrastructure/knowledge.md`**: Tier-2 summary with known env-mismatch failure patterns (e.g. Verilator < 5.0 lacks `--timing`, OpenROAD nightly vs release ABI drift, module-unload python3 fallback), successful flags/install notes, and tool quirks.
  - **Full memory-keeper integration**: `infrastructure` registered in `distill.py` `VALID_DOMAINS` and `METRIC_FIELDS` (`tools_detected`, `tools_missing`, `wrappers_deployed`, `mcp_servers_configured`) and added to the memory-keeper SKILL Domains table, so infrastructure quirks distil into `knowledge.md` via `/chip-design-infrastructure:memory-keeper --domain infrastructure`.

### Changed

- **`memory/README.md`**: added `infrastructure/` to the Directory Layout, an `infrastructure` row to the Domain key_metrics Fields table, and a new "Infrastructure memory (opt-in, environment-keyed)" subsection documenting the activation flag and env-keyed records.
- **`infrastructure-orchestrator.md`**: added Behaviour Rule 8 and an "Infrastructure Memory" section specifying the activation gate, session-start read, post-`environment_validation` upsert, and the environment-keyed record schema.

## [Unreleased] — feat/central-constraint-handling branch

### Added

- **Dynamic constraint loading from `design_state.constraints`** (FUTURE_WORK item 8): `design_state.constraints` is now the single source of truth for all design constraint values — clock target, area/power budgets, timing sign-off thresholds (WNS/TNS), utilisation targets, IR-drop limits, leakage budget, coverage targets, fault-coverage targets, HLS II/latency, and FPGA resource limits. All 11 constraint-bearing domain SKILL.md files now reference constraint keys (e.g. `design_state.constraints.timing.wns_ns_target`) instead of hardcoded literals; the literals are retained as documented defaults for backward compatibility.
- **Comprehensive `constraints` schema (`format_version "1.4"`)**: authoritative schema defined once in `plugins/meta/skills/pipeline-orchestration/SKILL.md` under `### Constraints Schema`. Nested by category: `clock`, `pvt_corners[]`, `timing`, `area`, `power`, `coverage`, `dft`, `hls`, `fpga`. All non-null defaults match the literals previously hardcoded in SKILL.md files.
- **Stage-entry constraint validation** (hard-fail on missing required constraints): every constraint-bearing orchestrator now reads `design_state.constraints` at its entry stage and, for each key in its required subset, performs an atomic RMW to set `pending_approval.type = "constraint_gap"` and halts when the key is missing or null. Optional constraints fall back to schema defaults with a WARN history entry. Required subsets: `clock.clk_mhz` (architecture, rtl-design, synthesis, sta, pd, soc, fpga); `area.area_um2` + `power.power_mw` (architecture, synthesis, pd); `pvt_corners` with non-null V/T (sta, pd); at least one of `hls.target_ii` or `hls.target_latency_cycles` (hls).
- **`pending_approval.type: "constraint_gap"`**: new discriminator value for the existing `pending_approval` mechanism. Pipeline-orchestrator prints a type-specific message directing the user to populate the missing constraint keys and clear `pending_approval` to resume.
- **`constraint_ref` tagging**: `history[]` entries now carry the dot-path constraint key compared at each QoR evaluation step (e.g. `"timing.wns_ns_target"`, `"power.power_mw"`, `"clock.clk_mhz"`), making every stage decision traceable to the constraint that gated it.
- **Updated `design_state.checkpoint.json` example**: `format_version` bumped to `"1.4"`, full `constraints` block added for `example_dsp_core` (500 MHz, 28nm), and `constraint_ref` set to real dot-path keys on `perf_modelling` (`"power.power_mw"`), `power_area_estimation`, `module_planning` (`"clock.clk_mhz"`), and `synth_check` (`"timing.wns_ns_target"`) history entries.

### Changed

- **`format_version "1.4"`**: new capability tier covering the full `constraints` object, stage-entry constraint validation, and `pending_approval.type: "constraint_gap"`. All 15 orchestrators upgrade to `"1.4"` on first write; prior-version files remain readable (`constraints` absent → apply schema defaults; missing `pending_approval.type` → treat as `"escalation"`).
- **Architecture orchestrator** (`architecture-orchestrator.md`): expanded `constraints` stub from `{clk_mhz, area_um2, power_mw}` to the full nested schema; added Behaviour Rule 8 (populate constraints during `spec_analysis`) and Behaviour Rule 9 (hard-fail if required keys remain null after extraction).
- **All 11 domain SKILL.md files** updated: `### QoR Metrics` and constraint-bearing `### Domain Rules` sections reworded to reference `design_state.constraints.<key>` with the prior literal as a documented default; each file gained a `## Constraint Validation` section listing the domain's required and optional keys.
- **`formal` and `dft` orchestrators**: `constraints` added to Design State Read extract list (was previously missing).
- **CI**: no schema-validation changes required — the edits are to tracked `.md` and `.json` files already covered by the existing lint checks.

---

## [Unreleased] — feat/approval-gates-traceability branch

### Added

- **Approval checkpoints** (FUTURE_WORK item 11, part A): proactive human-in-the-loop gates at any orchestrator's sign-off boundary, controlled by `pipeline_config.checkpoints[]` in `design_state.json`. Default positions: `arch_signoff`, `rtl_signoff`, and `signoff` (PD tape-out). When a checkpoint fires, the orchestrator sets `pending_approval { type: "checkpoint", stage, agent }` and halts without completing sign-off; the user resumes by adding the stage to `approved_checkpoints[]` and re-invoking. Empty `checkpoints` ⇒ fully autonomous (backward compatible).
- **Per-stage execution trace** (FUTURE_WORK item 11, part B): all 15 orchestrators now append one `history[]` entry per completed stage (PASS/FAIL/WARN) rather than a single terminal entry per run. Enables post-run audits without replaying the full agent conversation. Entry shape is unchanged (9-field schema).
- **`format_version "1.3"`**: new capability tier in `design_state.json` covering checkpoints + per-stage trace. All orchestrators upgrade to `"1.3"` on first write; prior-version files remain readable.
- **`design_state.checkpoint.json` fixture**: new golden example under `plugins/meta/skills/pipeline-orchestration/examples/` demonstrating a `pending_approval { type: "checkpoint" }` pause, `approved_checkpoints[]` entry, and per-stage history trace across architecture → RTL stages.

### Changed

- **`pending_approval` schema extended**: added `type` (`checkpoint` | `escalation`), `stage`, and `agent` fields. Backward-compatible — readers treating missing `type` as `"escalation"` remain correct.
- **Ownership rules amended**: domain orchestrators may now set `pending_approval` with `type: "checkpoint"` at their own sign-off stage; `type: "escalation"` remains the sole responsibility of the pipeline-orchestrator.
- **`pipeline_config` extended**: added `checkpoints` array (list of stage name strings, default `[]`).
- **`approved_checkpoints[]` added**: new top-level field; each entry `{ "stage", "approved_at", "approved_by" }`. Written by the user or by an orchestrator acting on an explicit approval instruction.
- **All 15 orchestrators updated**: Design State Read now extracts `pipeline_config` and `approved_checkpoints`; Design State Write upgrades `format_version` to `"1.3"`; all orchestrators carry two new Behaviour Rules (per-stage trace + checkpoint gate).
- **CI validation extended**: `VALID_FORMAT_VERSIONS` now includes `"1.3"`; new inline Python checks for `pipeline_config.checkpoints`, `approved_checkpoints`, `pending_approval.type`; both fixtures validated on every PR.
- **`memory/README.md`** updated with `format_version 1.3` tier, `checkpoints`, `approved_checkpoints`, and extended `pending_approval` field documentation.

---

## [Unreleased] — feat/rtl-verify-feedback-loop branch

### Added

- **Closed-loop verification↔RTL feedback** (FUTURE_WORK item 6): verification and formal orchestrators now write structured `fix_request` entries to `design_state.json` when a DUT bug or formal CEX is found, instead of suspending with prose-only output. The new `chip-design-meta` plugin (`plugins/meta/agents/pipeline-orchestrator.md`) detects open `fix_requests`, dispatches the RTL orchestrator to fix the bug, re-runs the originating verification or formal check, and loops up to 3 cross-domain iterations before escalating via `pending_approval`.
- **`fix_request` schema** (`format_version 1.1`): two new top-level fields in `design_state.json` — `fix_requests[]` (structured bug handoff with id, failure_class, suspected_rtl, waveform_path, status lifecycle) and `cross_domain_iteration_count` (integer cap enforced by the pipeline-orchestrator). Fully backward-compatible — all existing readers treat missing keys as null/zero.
- **`chip-design-meta` plugin** (`plugins/meta/`): 15th plugin in the marketplace, with `pipeline-orchestrator` agent, `pipeline-orchestration` skill (hosts authoritative fix_request schema and dispatch patterns), and persistent memory under `memory/meta/`.
- **Formal orchestrator fix_request support**: `formal-orchestrator.md` now writes `failure_class=formal_cex` fix_requests (including CEX trace path) on property counter-example, matching the verification orchestrator's protocol. Both route to the RTL orchestrator for fixing in V1.

### Changed

- **Plugin count**: 14 → 15 plugins. CI assertion in `validate.yml` and `ides/copilot/applyto-map.json` domain count updated accordingly.
- **`verification-orchestrator.md`**: loop-back rule for `directed_tests DUT bug found` and Behaviour Rule 4 updated to write structured fix_requests and exit with `decision=escalate`; Design State Read step extended to handle re-invocation context.
- **`rtl-design-orchestrator.md`**: Design State Read step extended to detect and claim open fix_requests; new Behaviour Rule 6 documents the fix_request close protocol.
- **`functional-verification/SKILL.md`**: Domain Rule 7 updated from "suspend and wait for confirmation" to "write fix_request and terminate for pipeline-orchestrator dispatch".
- **`memory/README.md`**: design_state.json schema documentation updated with `fix_requests[]`, `cross_domain_iteration_count`, and `format_version 1.1` details.
- **Divergence detection scoped to current session** (`pipeline_session_id`): the pipeline-orchestrator divergence check now compares only against `status=fixed` entries sharing the same `pipeline_session_id`, preventing false escalations when the same bug class legitimately recurs after a refactor in a later session.
- **Archival on signoff**: pipeline-orchestrator success branch moves resolved `fix_requests[]` entries into `design_state.archive_fix_requests[]` and resets session state, preventing unbounded array growth across long-running designs.
- **Configurable iteration cap** (`pipeline_config.max_cross_domain_iterations`): iteration limit lifted from hardcoded `3` to a user-tunable field in `design_state.json` (default 3 if absent). Set the field to tune per-design without editing agent files.
- **LEC unmatched-points loop intentionally deferred to V2**: `lec_run: unmatched points` in `formal-orchestrator.md` is not connected to the fix_request protocol in V1 — proper support requires `synthesis-orchestrator` as a consumer. Documented in `pipeline-orchestration/SKILL.md` V2 extension points.
- **Removed vestigial per-entry `iteration_count`** (S1): `fix_request` schema no longer includes `iteration_count` — the field was always 0 or 1 in practice because re-failures open a *new* entry. The top-level `cross_domain_iteration_count` is the sole iteration counter. Removed from `meta/SKILL.md`, both producer agent schemas, `rtl-design-orchestrator.md` Behaviour Rule 6 and Write step 5a, the fixture, and CI `REQUIRED_FIELDS`.
- **Seeded `memory/meta/experiences.jsonl`** (S7): two illustrative records added — one `converged` (single-iteration MAC unit fix) and one `escalated` (AXI DMA cap exceeded after 3 iterations).
- **Marketplace version bump** and **README reconciliation** (Cosmetic): `metadata.version` bumped to `1.3.0`; README header updated to "15 plugins · 16 skill files"; `chip-design-meta` added to the Available Plugins table.

## [Unreleased] — agent-scope-review branch

### Added
- **Pre-run context** (`## Pre-run Context`) section added to all 13 domain SKILL.md files:
  agents now read `knowledge.md` and `run_state.md` at every invocation point, not only
  at orchestrator session start.
- **Run-state tracking**: all 13 domain SKILL.md files and the PD orchestrator now write
  `memory/<domain>/run_state.md` as the first action before any tool invocation; `last_stage`
  is updated after each stage so wakeup-loop prompts can resume correctly.
- **Per-stage experience writes**: PD orchestrator (and all domain skills) now upsert to
  `experiences.jsonl` after each stage rather than only on session end; partial runs are
  persisted even if the session is interrupted.
- **Optional claude-mem integration**: all 13 domain skills and the memory-keeper skill now
  emit applied fixes to `mcp__plugin_ecc_memory__add_observations` when the MCP tool is
  present; guard clause skips silently when absent so JSONL remains the canonical record.
- **Clock gating opportunity analysis** added to `architecture` SKILL.md
  (`power_area_estimation` stage): classifies each clock domain by activity factor α,
  produces a `clock_power_budget` hand-off table (domain → frequency, α, est. clock power,
  gating class), and enforces a new QoR gate (≥ 70% of register bits in gateable domains).
- **Power intent / ICG insertion rules** added to `rtl-design` SKILL.md (`rtl_coding` stage):
  RTL agent reads `clock_power_budget` from architecture hand-off and inserts ICG cells for
  high/moderate gating domains; enforces `clock_gating_coverage` ≥ 60% QoR gate.
- **Architecture → RTL handoff contract** updated in `docs/MASTER_INDEX.md` to include
  `clock_power_budget` artifact.
- `memory/README.md` updated to document run_state.md, per-stage write semantics, `run_id`
  schema field, and the optional claude-mem index pattern.
- `docs/Architecture_Evaluation_Flow.md` and `docs/RTL_Design_Flow.md` updated to match
  the new clock gating analysis and ICG insertion rules added to the live SKILL.md files.
- OpenROAD MCP config (`mcp-openroad.json`) comment improved to call out the two placeholder
  values that require substitution during installation.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-14

### Added
- Multiple IDE support: GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini Code Assist, and OpenCode
- `ides/copilot/` — Copilot workspace instructions and per-domain file-glob mapping (`applyto-map.json`)
- `ides/gemini/` — preamble header injected into a generated `GEMINI.md`
- `ides/opencode/` — base OpenCode config template with all 13 chip-design modes
- `install.sh --ide <copilot|gemini|opencode|all>` flag to deploy IDE-specific config into the target project
- `install.ps1 -IDE <copilot|gemini|opencode|all>` equivalent for Windows PowerShell
- CI/CD validation extended to lint IDE config files on every PR

### Changed
- Agents and skills updated with explicit EDA tool usage annotations
- AgentShield CI step removed (no `.claude` directory present in repo)

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- AgentShield CI check to validate Claude agent files on every PR

- Issues reported after CodeRabbit review pass on the AgentShield integration

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Install scripts for all OS: `install.sh` (macOS / Linux / Git Bash) and `install.ps1` (Windows PowerShell)
- `strict: true` set in `marketplace.json` to enforce exact plugin paths

### Changed
- **Breaking restructure:** all 13 agents and skills split from a shared flat directory into isolated per-plugin subdirectories (`plugins/<domain>/agents/` and `plugins/<domain>/skills/`) to eliminate file-system racing conditions when multiple plugins load concurrently
- Each plugin now has its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest
- CI/CD updated for the new directory layout
- README updated to document the new structure and remove the prior racing-issue caveat

### Fixed
- Recursion guard added to agent and skill invocation chains
- Agents now read their skill file before executing; skills now spawn the corresponding orchestrator before executing
